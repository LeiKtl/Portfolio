            <p className='home_content'>Hi, I'm Leila Ketterle but people usually call me Lei, living in the north of France. I studied literature in High School and I always wanted to do a creative work. It's a movie -more like a serie- that made me curious of IT profession. After a lot of research, front-end developer's was a job which brought together several criteria such as creation, constant learning and diversity of tasks, which I wanted in my future profession. So i started to learn the basics of programmation by myself, and decided to start a training course with OpenClassrooms, to be able to have a certificate in this area and be able to  make it my job.</p>
